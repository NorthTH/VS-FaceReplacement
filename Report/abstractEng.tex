The face is one important human identity. People want to be good-looking in their photographs. With digital technology, people can take their personal photos in digital format. Digital photos can be used for image processing later on. There are many applications which deal with human faces such as face recognition, face modeling, facial animation, face editing, etc. In this project, we focus on the facial editing aspect. We developed a system called “Automatic Face Replacement in Photographs”. This system is able to replace a face in an image with another face to get a new realistic image. The steps of face replacement are face detection, face contour creation, alignment, color adjustment, and blending. We implemented this system with OpenCV library and dnAnalytics linear solver. We also performed a user study to consider the quality of the results. This system helps people reduce time spent on editing faces and to easily get realistic face images.
